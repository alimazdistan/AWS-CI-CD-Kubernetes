**Project Overview**

This project is a web-based application built with modern tools and practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. Below is an outline of the technologies and configurations used in this project:

### Key Technologies and Tools

1. **Frontend Framework**: Although the focus is not on the React and HTML coding, itâ€™s evident that the project uses modern frontend technologies managed by tools like `vite` for efficient development.

2. **Docker**: A `Dockerfile` is provided to containerize the application, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.

3. **Kubernetes**:

   - The `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` files indicate that this project is designed to run in a Kubernetes cluster.
   - These files manage the deployment and exposure of the application to users via Kubernetes services.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: The `buildspec.yml` file suggests the use of AWS CodeBuild or a similar system for continuous integration and deployment.

5. **Linting and Code Quality**:

   - The `eslint.config.js` file implies that ESLint is configured to maintain consistent code quality and enforce coding standards.

6. **Package Management**:

   - The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files define the dependencies and scripts for the project, managed through Node.js and npm.

7. **Shell Script for Installation**:

   - An `install.sh` script is included, likely used for setting up dependencies or configuring the application during deployment.

### Directory and File Highlights

- **`public` Directory**: Contains static assets that are likely served directly.
- **`src` Directory**: The main source code of the application.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation file that can be updated to include project setup instructions and usage.

### Summary

This project is a comprehensive example of modern web application development and deployment, leveraging Docker and Kubernetes for scalability and portability, and integrating CI/CD practices to streamline development workflows.
